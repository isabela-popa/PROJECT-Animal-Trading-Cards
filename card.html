			<p>The domestic dog is a wolf-like canid in the genus Canis, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog
				is the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities,
				and physical attributes.
				<br> Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. They perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads,
				protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic
				roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet "man's best friend".
